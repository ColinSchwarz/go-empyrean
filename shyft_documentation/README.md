Getting Set Up
Fork this repository on GitHub.
Clone your forked repository (not our original one) to your hard drive with git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/slate.git
cd slate
Initialize and start Slate. You can either do this locally, or with Vagrant:
# either run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server

# OR run this to run with vagrant
vagrant up
You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567. Whoa! That was fast!

Now that Slate is all set up on your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about editing Slate markdown, or how to publish your docs.

If you'd prefer to use Docker, instructions are available in the wiki.
